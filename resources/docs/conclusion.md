# Conclusion

I hope this Bootcamp served as an introduction to how you can use the premises provided the Hotwire way of building web apps and hybrid native apps.

There's a lot more we can do with this toolset, but I think this is a good stopping point for the Bootcamp.

If you want to know more about Hotwire, here's some recommendation links:

- [The hotwire dev newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/hotwire) by [Joe Masilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)
- [The Hotwire Example Template Repository](https://github.com/thoughtbot/hotwire-example-template/branches/stale) has tons and tons of examples written by Sean Doyle

There are other paid courses and books, but I'll only mention the free things here. If you have other free material hubs or compilation, please send it my way so I can update it here.

I'd love to hear what you think about this Bootcamp and Turbo Laravel. Feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tonysmdev) or [email me](mailto:tonysm@hey.com) to share your thoughts. Go build something amazing!
